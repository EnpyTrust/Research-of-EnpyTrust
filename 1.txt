It was there, waiting for some one to pick it up... an encryption algorithm that is Quantum Resisant, further research revealed "impossible algorithm" is not so impossible, this algorithm? IS quanum resistant, and its called... LMEA (Logical Mathamatical Encryption Algorithm). we did this by, 1. having the  algorithm expand when the key gets bigger. 2. it supports key sizes 1024-65536 bits. 3. when the algorithm grows, the chance of that Quantum Computer to decrypt it without the key can go so low, it it considerd... 0%... This may seem fake, But the records DON'T lie.
